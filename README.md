# SICERS-package

This is an implementation of SICERS package for multi-network data in Matlab. The details are included in the manuscript: "Statistical inference for covariate-related subnetworks in multi-network brain connectome data". 

# Codes

The "SICERS.m" is a function to detect covariated-related subnetworks from the matrix of edge-wise inference results.
The "PermTest_pval.m" is the implementation of Algorithm 2 in the manuscript to test the significance of subnetworks. 

# Examples
We include a small simulation example in "demo.m". This file includes the generating mechanism of a simulation data set and the implementation of SICERS. To see the demonstrative document with codes and output, please refer to "demo.html" observed from the publish option of Matlab.
